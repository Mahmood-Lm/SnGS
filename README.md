This repository contains the code and methodology for our high-performance pipeline for the **SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction (GSR) Challenge**. Our approach systematically enhances the official baseline model, addressing key bottlenecks to achieve a significant boost in accuracy. Our work secured the **second-best performance** among all participants, demonstrating a **120% improvement** over the baseline on the challenge set.

## Abstract

The SoccerNet Game State Reconstruction (GSR) challenge provides a crucial benchmark for analyzing player tracking and identification from broadcast soccer videos. While the official baseline model offers a solid foundation, its performance is hampered by key bottlenecks in complex scenarios. This paper introduces a series of targeted enhancements to create a new, high-performance pipeline. We systematically address the primary weaknesses of the baseline by integrating four key improvements: (1) a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for robust athlete detection, (2) a fine-tuned CLIP model for accurate jersey number recognition, (3) a novel team clustering method using SIGLIP embeddings, and (4) the "No Bells, Just Whistles" method for precise pitch localization. Evaluated on the SoccerNet-GSR dataset, our proposed pipeline demonstrates a remarkable performance increase, achieving a GS-HOTA score of 51.52 on the challenge set‚Äîa 120% improvement over the baseline.

## üöÄ Key Features & Enhancements

Our pipeline replaces critical components of the SoccerNet-GSR baseline to achieve state-of-the-art results.

1.  **‚öΩ Robust Athlete Detection:**
    * Replaced the standard YOLOv8x with a model **fine-tuned on the SoccerNet v3 H250 dataset**.
    * This significantly reduces false positives (e.g., detecting fans) and false negatives (e.g., missing occluded players).

2.  **üî¢ Accurate Jersey Number Recognition:**
    * Replaced the baseline's MMOCR with a **fine-tuned CLIP (ViT-L-14) model**.
    * Overcomes failures of traditional OCR on low-resolution text and varied fonts by leveraging powerful vision-language representations.
    * Includes a data cleaning step to correct label noise in the original dataset.

3.  **üëï Superior Team Clustering:**
    * Replaced K-means clustering on ReID embeddings with a more robust method using pre-trained **SIGLIP embeddings**.
    * Accurately separates teams even when uniforms are visually similar.

4.  **üó∫Ô∏è Precise Pitch Localization:**
    * Replaced the baseline's TVCalib with the state-of-the-art **"No Bells, Just Whistles" (NBJW)** method.
    * Achieves highly accurate camera calibration and player projection, especially in challenging center-pitch camera views.

## üìä Performance

Our enhanced pipeline demonstrates a substantial improvement over the baseline across all official SoccerNet-GSR datasets. The core evaluation metric is **GS-HOTA**, which measures both localization and identification accuracy.

### Challenge Set Results

Our method achieved the **2nd rank** on the official challenge leaderboard.
